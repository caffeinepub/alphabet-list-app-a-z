# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated “A words” page and navigation from the existing A–Z alphabet page.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a second frontend page/view that displays a titled list of English words starting with “A”.
- Add a clear navigation control from the main A–Z alphabet page to the new “A words” page.
- Add an obvious way to return from the “A words” page back to the main A–Z page.
- Populate the “A words” page with a static curated list of at least 25 “A” words (no network requests).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a new page from the alphabet screen to view a scrollable list of words that start with “A”, and easily navigate back to the main A–Z page.
