  "summary": "REQ-6 and REQ-7 appear implemented via a clickable A–Z grid and state-based navigation to a generic LetterWordsPage with a dynamic header subtitle and a “Back to Alphabet” button. REQ-8 is partially evidenced by adding a unified letterWords dataset importing existing A words, but the diff is truncated so completeness for all letters A–Z cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "The new unified dataset file is truncated, so it’s not verifiable from the provided diff summary that curated lists exist for every letter through Z (and thus that selecting any letter, e.g. X/Z, will display its corresponding list).",
